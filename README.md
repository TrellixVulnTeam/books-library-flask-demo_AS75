# books-library-flask-demo
Demo app for python `"flask"` framework `[a microframework]`

Python has many full-stack and non full-stack web frameworks 
   <ul><li><b>Flask</b> (non full-stack)</li>
   <li>Django (full-stack)</li>
   <li>...etc</li>
   </ul>

So, for practice purpose I created this app "books-library" using `flask`. Where you can `add`,`search` & `view` books.
This app has no database to store added book, as just for demonstration purpose I used a global variable to store the book's info.

Also utilized the jinja templating (too east to understand). Would suggest this site to learn jinja designing templates http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/

### How UI looks :-

_UI was not intention of this app_ but functionality was

  #### 1. Home page with books details 
  <center><img src="https://github.com/khanabid20/books-library-flask-demo/blob/master/images/books-home.PNG" alt="home" /></center>

  #### 2. Add book info

   ![add book](https://github.com/khanabid20/books-library-flask-demo/blob/master/images/add-book.PNG)

  #### 3. Search particular book by name
  
   ![search book](https://github.com/khanabid20/books-library-flask-demo/blob/master/images/search-book.PNG)
  <hr />
  
   ![found book](https://github.com/khanabid20/books-library-flask-demo/blob/master/images/found-book.PNG)
